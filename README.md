# 50 Projects in 50 Days

## HTML/SASS/CSS and JavaScript

This is the main repository for all of the projects in the course. I will add projects as the course progress. I have done some changes in this, because I also want to train my SASS skills, and I may have done some other changes as I go as well.

If you want to take the course (on Udemy) as it is, you can click the link: [Course Link](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days). The original project files for the course, can be found on [GitHub/bradtraversy/50projects50days](https://github.com/bradtraversy/50projects50days).

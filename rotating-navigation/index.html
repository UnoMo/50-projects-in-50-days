				<h1>Seattle - Pike Place Market</h1>
				<small>Public market in Seattle, Washington, United States</small>
				<p>
					Pike Place Market is a public market in Seattle, Washington, United States. It opened on August 17,
					1907, and is one of the oldest continuously operated public farmers' markets in the United States.
					Overlooking the Elliott Bay waterfront on Puget Sound, it serves as a place of business for many
					small farmers, craftspeople and merchants. It is named for its central street, Pike Place, which
					runs northwest from Pike Street to Virginia Street on the western edge of Downtown Seattle. Pike
					Place Market is Seattle's most popular tourist destination and the 33rd most visited tourist
					attraction in the world, with more than 10 million annual visitors.[2] The Market is built on the
					edge of a steep hill and consists of several lower levels located below the main level. Each
					features a variety of unique shops such as antique dealers, comic book and collectible shops, small
					family-owned restaurants, and one of the oldest head shops in Seattle. The upper street level
					contains fishmongers, fresh produce stands and craft stalls operating in the covered arcades. Local
					farmers and craftspeople sell year-round in the arcades from tables they rent from the Market on a
					daily basis, in accordance with the Market's mission and founding goal: allowing consumers to "Meet
					the Producer". Pike Place Market is home to nearly 500 residents who live in eight different
					buildings throughout the Market. Most of these buildings have been low-income housing in the past;
					however, some of them no longer are, such as the Livingston Baker apartments. The Market is run by
					the quasi-government Pike Place Market Preservation and Development Authority (PDA).

					The Market is located roughly in the northwest corner of Seattle's central business district. To its
					north is Belltown. To its southwest are the central waterfront and Elliott Bay. Boundaries are
					diagonal to the compass since the street grid is roughly parallel to the Elliott Bay
					shoreline.[3][4][5] As is common with Seattle neighborhoods and districts,[4] different people and
					organizations draw different boundaries for the market. The City Clerk's Neighborhood Map Atlas
					gives one of the more expansive definitions, defining a "Pike-Market" neighborhood extending from
					Union Street northwest to Virginia Street and from the waterfront northeast to Second Avenue.[3]
					Despite coming from the City Clerk's office, this definition has no special official status.[4] The
					smaller "Pike Place Public Market Historic District" listed on the U.S. National Register of
					Historic Places is bounded roughly by First Avenue, Virginia Street, Western Avenue, and a building
					wall about halfway between Union and Pike Streets, running parallel to those streets.[6]
